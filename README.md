II. Code Implementation:
In the implemented code, a worker moves between buildings, carrying one unit of one resource at a time. The player can check at any moment which resource the worker is currently carrying. If the worker cannot take a resource from the extraction building, he should wait until the resource is produced. If the worker cannot take a resource from the production building, he should give up on it and attempt to move a resource from the extraction building to the production building
